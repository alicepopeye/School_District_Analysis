# # Summary
    I am so surprise how little the changes is by removing the 9th graders at The Thomas High School. Then I start to see it like there are 4 students. All 4 are A's students. Then you remove one, the average for the remained 3 students are still A.

    In district wise, 1.18% of the student counts is too small to make any differencs for the big pictures.

    If the 9th graders' original passing average is very low, then it will be whole differnt story for Thomas High School and it will effect the school performing list.
